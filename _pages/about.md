Hi! I'm a current PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Harvard. I graduated from Princeton in 2022, where I majored in Mathematics.

My current research interests are in Probability Theory, High-Dimensional Statistics, and ML theory. Some topics I am interested in include Random Matrices, Graph Neural Networks, and Concentration Inequalities. 

I'm an Age of Empires II enthusiast, and I play tennis, poker, and enjoy rock climbing. 

Feel free to email me at alanchung@g.harvard.edu!
